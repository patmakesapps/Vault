---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18 or higher (just download and install)

### Run in dev mode
```bash
# 1. Unzip / navigate to this folder
cd vault-app

# 2. Install dependencies (one time)
npm install

# 3. Launch the desktop app
npm run dev
```

That's it. A desktop window will open.

## Build a distributable installer

```bash
npm run build
```

This outputs to the `dist-electron/` folder:
- **Windows**: `Vault Setup 1.0.0.exe`
- **macOS**: `Vault-1.0.0.dmg`
- **Linux**: `Vault-1.0.0.AppImage`

---

## App Icon (optional)

To use a custom icon, replace these files in `src/assets/`:
- `icon.png` — 512×512 PNG (used for Linux + dev)
- `icon.ico` — Windows icon (you can convert from PNG at https://icoconvert.com)
- `icon.icns` — macOS icon (use `iconutil` on Mac or an online converter)

## Auto-Backup Setup

1. Open the app and unlock your vault
2. Click **Settings** in the sidebar
3. Choose a folder — point it at your **Dropbox**, **iCloud Drive**, or **Google Drive** folder
4. Every time you save an entry, a timestamped `.vault` backup is written there automatically

The backup file is fully encrypted. Even if someone gets the file, they can't read it without your master password.
